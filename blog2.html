                        Individuals, rather than businesses, are more important than ever in guiding the future of the internet. The web gets its name from the interconnected web of individual nodes that gives life to a massive network. Instead of being powered by a small number of large firms like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google, the web must function for people. But, what if these influential web pages from different people disappear?


                    </p>

                       Individuals can simply have a website and direct the web back to its original architecture. Artists in particular, can play an important role in this space by demonstrating to the rest of the world the potential of the internet.

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, it is difficult to keep websites updated when it is uploaded by individuals. It is a constant cycle of work that the person must be committed to. Failure of keeping up with uploaded websites causes a trait of inconsistency through the web.

                        The Web exists in an infinite present. It is ethereal, fleeting, unstable, and unreliable at its core. When you try to access a Web page, you may see an error message that says "Page Not Found." This is known as "link rot," and while it is inconvenient, it is preferable to the alternative. You'll notice an updated Web page more frequently; the original has most certainly been overwritten. (In computing, overwriting implies erasing old data and replacing it with fresh data; overwriting is a relic of a time when computer storage was prohibitively expensive.) Perhaps the page has been relocated and something else has taken its place. This is known as "content drift," and it's more dangerous than an error notice because you can't determine if what you're seeing isn't what you expected to see because the original has been overwritten, erased, or moved. 


                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Link rot and content drift, generally known as "reference rot," have been terrible for the law and the courts. Legal scholars, lawyers, and judges frequently cite Web pages in their footnotes when providing evidence; they want the evidence to stay where they discovered it as proof, just as evidence on paper—in court records, books, and law journals—stays where it was found, in libraries and courthouses. However, a 2013 study of law- and policy-related publications found that over half of the URLs listed in those articles had stopped working after six years.

                       As the article called “The Cobweb,” on The Newyorker, brings up the question of what if the URL we used vanishes? With the constant development of the web, individuals who have sourced a URL for supporting evidence can now save the web page and download it on their computer. This can lead to copyright infringement, especially if the individual plans to take this work and publish it when it disappears. There are many loopholes being developed right now, but what about boundaries?
