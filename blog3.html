                        In terms of design, inclusivity refers to creating products that are equally beneficial and inclusive of all people, regardless of their personal differences. We must examine the outliers while contemplating inclusion. What should we do when designing for colorblind people? How do you account for age differences in your designs? When it comes to designing your product, everyone should be treated equally. They should be able to do the same things and have the same possibilities. Consider it like creating a miniature version of the world where everyone is made equal, all within the confines of our devices. So, how do we create exclusivity in our designs? How does the product maintain its exclusivity if it is so crucial to incorporate everyone?

                       To exclude is to deny a person or group access to a place, a group, or a privilege. We may exclude intentionally or unintentionally based on race and ethnicity, gender, age, linguistics, or ability. If we want to build truly inclusive websites, our own knowledge is insufficient. We  require experience in the design of interfaces for those who are excluded.

                    <p>
                        To see how we exclude, we have to learn to see whose voice is missing, learn to be open to understanding different perspectives, and create space for plurality. In addition to recognizing exclusion, we also have to learn how to be attentive and listen to people when they feel excluded. It is important to have a good representation of generations, race, gender, disabilities, and culture in your user interviews and usability studies. Designing with accessibility in mind naturally removes our biases and improves the overall experience of our products and services. Nevertheless, considering those with technology or socioeconomic barriers will also take any design solution to a higher maturity level.

                        Designers need to understand their positionality when it comes to their designs. "Positionality statement," where one can reflect on their positionality to understand where their biases might lie. Bringing elements of our identities and our biases to the forefront can help us 
						see which of our own practices might be exclusionary.

                    <p>
                        Ignore conventions. The original inclusive principle states that you should stick to well-known practices. Simply stated, contemporary conventions are created by and for designers. Non-designers may not be able to use all of these conventions. If we want to incorporate non-designers, particularly persons with impairments, we should revisit these norms after learning more about their circumstances.

                       Be mindful of ethical responsibilities. It is important that the designer gives homage and credit to the culture they’re willing to represent. A designer’s responsibility is to treat a cultural exchange like any other creative collaboration- give credit, and consider royalties. Representation and inclusion can be an alternative cultural appropriation by acknowledging someone else’s culture and showing appreciation/ giving credit for their culture, rather than taking it and making it your own.
