                        Yahoo!, Inc. is a digital media firm that uses research, communications, and digital content offerings to inform, connect, and entertain users. Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific are the three geographical segments across which it operates. Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang and David Filo launched the company in January 1994, and it is based in Sunnyvale, California.

                        Yang and Filo were graduate students in electrical engineering at Stanford University when they created "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web" in January 1994. Rather than a searchable index of pages, the site was a human-edited web directory organized in a hierarchy. "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!" in March 1994, and the Yahoo Directory was born. On January 18, 1995, the domain "yahoo.com" was registered.

                        "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle." The Yahoo database was organized in layers of subcategories, which was referred to as "hierarchical." The title "oracle" was intended to indicate "source of truth and wisdom," while the term "officious" was intended to describe the numerous office workers who would utilize the Yahoo database while surfing from work, rather than the word's conventional definition. Filo and Yang, on the other hand, claim they chose the name mostly because they liked the slang meaning of a "yahoo" (a term used by college students in David Filo's home Louisiana in the late 1980s to refer to an ignorant, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, vulgar." This meaning is derived from Gulliver's Travels' Yahoo race of mythical humans.

                    <p>
                        On March 2, 1995, Yahoo was founded. Yahoo Search, a search engine function, was introduced in 1995. Users were able to search the Yahoo Directory as a result of this. Yahoo quickly rose to prominence as the first popular online directory and search engine on the Internet.

                        During the 1990s, Yahoo grew at a fast pace. Yahoo, like many other search engines and online directories, launched a web portal, putting it in direct rivalry with Excite, Lycos, and America Online. By 1998, Yahoo had become the most popular web portal and the human-edited Yahoo Directory had become the most popular search engine, with 95 million page views per day, more than quadruple that of rival Excite. It also made a number of high-profile purchases. Following the acquisition of RocketMail, which was later renamed to Yahoo Mail, Yahoo began delivering free e-mail in October 1997. Inktomi, Yahoo's crawler-based search engine, succeeded AltaVista as the Directory's crawler-based search engine in 1998.

                        Yahoo has made many changes to its website throughout the years. Compared to the first photo and the second photo, they have organized their page and changed their color scheme. Yahoo now has a signature purple color scheme, and before there was not an established palette. Their concept is still mostly the same, but more organized.

                    <p>
                        Comparing then and now, Yahoo has incorporated many typical features of a current website. They have organized their page to make it user friendly and not as cluttered as before. They also now use a lot of images and icons to their page. The news is also now the main context of the page,  compared to before where it was only on the side. Shopping is no longer important in their home page, but it is still an offered category. Overall the hierarchy has changed, and I’m assuming that the order is according to trends. Unfortunately, Yahoo’s status has deteriorated over the years.
